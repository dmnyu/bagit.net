# BagIt.NET v0.2.1 – Internal Update

**Release Type:** Internal / Refactor  
**Date:** 2025-11-24

## Overview
This release is an internal refactor aimed at improving **dependency injection**, testability, and service-oriented architecture. No functional changes to the BagIt specification handling have been introduced.

## Key Changes
- **Static classes replaced with services**
  - `ChecksumService` `ManifestService`, and `TagFileService` are now proper injectable services instead of static helpers.
  - All previous static calls have been updated to use dependency injection.
  - `BagInfoService` merged into `TagFileService`

- **Direct constructor injection**
  - Services are now injected into test fixtures and orchestrators like `Bagger` via constructors.
  - Reduces coupling and improves unit testing isolation.

- **Improved unit testing**
  - Unit tests for `ChecksumService`, `ManifestService`, and `TagFileService` now leverage DI for clean setup.
  - Temp directories are handled consistently per test case.

## Benefits
- Looser coupling between components.
- Fully testable services without static dependencies.
- Simplified orchestration in `Bagger`.
- Foundation laid for the upcoming `FileManagerService` (v0.2.2).

## Notes
- No changes to BagIt bag creation, payload manifest, or tag file handling behavior.
- Internal-only release; no external API impact.
