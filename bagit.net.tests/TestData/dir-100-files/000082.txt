 REPORT  AND  ORDER  (Proceeding  Terminated) 
 Adopted:  August  24,  2005  Released:  August  26,  2005 
 By  the  Assistant  Chief,  Audio  Division,  Media  Bureau: 
 1.  The  Audio  Division  has  before  it  a  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking  1  issued  at  the  request  of  Dr.  Sandra  L.  Woodruff  (“  Petitioner”)  requesting  the  allotment  of  Channel  229C3  at  Tenino, 
 Washington,  as  the  community’s  first  local  service.  Petitioner  did  not  file  comments  reiterating  her  continuing  interest  in  applying  for  Channel  229C3  at  Tenino.  2  No  other  comments  or  counterproposals 
 were  received. 
 2.  As  stated  in  the  Notice,  a  showing  of  continuing  interest  is  required  before  a  channel  will  be  allotted.  It  is  the  Commission’s  policy  to  refrain  from  making  an  allotment  to  a  community  absent  an 


 expression  of  interest.  Therefore,  since  no  such  continuing  interest  has  been  expressed  for  an  allotment  at  Tenino,  Washington,  we  will  dismiss  Petitioner’s  proposal. 


 3.  This  document  is  not  subject  to  the  Congressional  Review  Act.  (The  Commission,  is,  therefore,  not  required  to  submit  a  copy  of  this  Report  and  Order  to  Government  Accountability  Office, 
 pursuant  to  the  Congressional  Review  Act,  see  5  U.  S.  C.  Section  801(  a)(  1)(  A)  since  this  proposed  rule  is  dismissed,  herein.) 


 4.  In  view  of  the  above,  IT  IS  ORDERED  That  the  Petition  for  Rule  Making  filed  by  Dr.  Sandra  L.  Woodruff  (RM-  11236),  requesting  the  allotment  of  Channel  229C3  at  Tenino,  Washington,  IS 
 DISMISSED. 
 5.  IT  IS  FURTHER  ORDERED,  That  this  proceeding  IS  TERMINATED.
