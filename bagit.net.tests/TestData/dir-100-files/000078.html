<font face="arial" size=3><b><p> Temporary Road Closures Near Wickiup Dam</b></font>
<font face="arial" size=2><p>Bureau of Reclamation officials are urging residents and visitors who utilize U.S. Forest Service roads near Wickiup Dam to plan for alternate routes.  Several USFS roads in the vicinity of Wickiup Dam will be closed from August 20 through October 6, 2003.

<p>The closures are necessary during the safety of dams repair work at Wickiup Dam where heavy equipment will travel to and from the construction site.  Plans should be made to use alternative routes during this time period (see map).

<p>Forest Service roads 860, 920, and 600 from Highway 44 to Forest Service Road 690, and 600 from the Tenino boat ramp to the dam will be closed except for emergency access.  Recreation traffic accessing the Tenino boat ramp on the south side of the Deschutes River should use Forest Service Road 690 to the open segment of 600 and on to the boat ramp.

<p>Access to the north borrow area will be along Forest Service Roads 4380 to 900 and then to 915.  Flaggers and traffic controls will be used during peak hauling periods to control traffic on the open segment of Forest Service Road 4380, roads 900 and 915 will be closed.  Recreation traffic to the Wickiup Butte Campground and boat ramp can use Forest Service Road 4260 on the crest of the dam.  Forest Service Road 4370 below the dam along the north side of the Deschutes River will also remain open to the public.

<p>Wickiup Dam, is being upgraded to meet current seismic standards.  Wickiup Dam, part of the Deschutes Project, provides 200,000 acre-feet of storage for irrigation to 50,000 acres within the North Unit Irrigation District.  North Unit Irrigation District operates and maintains the dam which is owned by Reclamation.

<p>For more information on the road closures, contact the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation Wickiup Dam Field Office, telephone (541) 536-8059, or the Bend Field Office at (541) 389-0233.
